# 📊 Task 1 – Student Score Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Predict students' exam scores based on study hours and other performance factors.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Recommended: [Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors))  

## ⚙️ Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (visualizations)  
- Train-test split  
- Linear Regression model
- Applied **Polynomial Regression** to capture nonlinear relationships  
- Compared performance with Linear Regression  
- Evaluation using metrics (MAE, R²)  

## 📈 Results
- Polynomial Regression outperformed Linear Regression, giving better predictions for student scores. 
  

## 🛠 Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
