# 🌟 Elevvo Internship – Completed Tasks

This repository contains my completed projects for the **Elevvo Internship Program**.  
I worked on 5 machine learning and deep learning tasks covering **regression, clustering, classification, and computer vision**.  
The projects demonstrate skills in **data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization** using industry-standard tools.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. [Task 1 – Student Score Prediction](./Task-1-Student-Score-Prediction)  
   → Predicted student exam scores using **Polynomial Regression**, improving performance over Linear Regression.

2. [Task 2 – Customer Segmentation](./Task-2-Customer-Segmentation)  
   → Applied **DBSCAN clustering** to segment mall customers and detect outliers, beyond traditional K-Means.

3. [Task 3 – Forest Cover Classification](./Task-3-Forest-Cover-Classification)  
   → Classified forest cover types with **Random Forest (88.8% accuracy)** and **XGBoost (84.2% accuracy)**; Random Forest performed best.

4. [Task 4 – Loan Approval Prediction](./Task-4-Loan-Approval-Prediction)  
   → Handled imbalanced data using **SMOTE**. Logistic Regression baseline (F1 = 0.50) improved to (F1 = 0.70), and **Decision Tree achieved F1 = 0.96**.

5. [Task 8 – Traffic Sign Recognition](./Task-8-Traffic-Sign-Recognition)  
   → Built a **Custom CNN** achieving **99.6% test accuracy**, far outperforming MobileNet (39.7%).
